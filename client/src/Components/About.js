        <h4>What is Marble?</h4>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Building, Design, March 30, 2016 by Anya arabescato_statuary_marble
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Beloved by emperors and artisans alike, marble has been one of the
          most beautiful and sought-after stones for centuries. Whether it’s as
          pure white as snow or streaked with dramatic, colorful veins, each
          piece of marble is a unique and stunning work of art and, when used in
          the home, adds an undeniable touch of luxury and opulence. But, what
          is marble, really? Let’s demystify how this stone comes to be and why
          it’s been beloved for so long.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble is a metamorphic rock, which is a rock that has been physically
          and chemically transformed over time due to intense heat and pressure.
          Marble begins life as limestone, which is a soft stone made primarily
          of calcite. Under heat and pressure caused by magma or the tectonic
          plates, this limestone begins to recrystallize, changing the texture
          of the rock and causing the calcite crystals to grow and interlock.
          Marble can be found in many areas around the world, from Macedonia to
          Vermont, but the most famous varieties come from Italy and Greece,
          where it is often purest in color.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Purity, of course, refers to the lack of color variation within a
          specific sample of stone. Although colored veining is, for many
          people, a very desired characteristic, the purest marbles are almost
          completely white or very light in color. The veining is caused by
          mineral deposits that are either within the original limestone or are
          present as the limestone is transforming into marble. The minerals
          tend to settle in layers, which we call “veining”. Depending on the
          amount of minerals present in the stone, the veining can either be
          very minimal — thin, delicate lines — or dramatic — large swaths of
          colors that can seem almost like smoke within the marble.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Minerals present during recrystallization can sometimes tint the
          entire piece of marble in a wide variety of colors. Blues, grays,
          pinks, and reds are the most common, but green, purple and yellow
          marbles can also be found. Clay, mica, quartz, iron oxides are some of
          the most common minerals found in marble and cause reddish, gray, and
          white tints or veining. Hematite and iron oxides are also often
          present and can create red, pink, and brown hues while limonite causes
          a yellow coloration and serpentine a deep, rich green.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Regardless of the coloration, one of the most unique aspects of marble
          is that it’s translucent, meaning you can see past the outer surface.
          Although no marble is completely transparent, you can often see
          through at least a few millimeters of the stone, which is one of the
          reasons it has been used so extensively in sculpture. The translucency
          of the stone gives it more depth, making statues of people feel whole
          and alive than sculptures made with more opaque material.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble is the perfect softness for carving though its sensitivity can
          be a detriment in many cases. Although many marble buildings and
          sculptures have stood for thousands of years, weather and temperature
          differentials can cause it to break and erode, as do acids. That being
          said, it still takes quite a lot of work to quarry. Marble deposits
          can often be enormous, and explosives are needed in order to begin
          breaking up the rock. Machines then help create grooves in the stone,
          which are leveraged to split it from the rock face.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble is still used extensively in building today and can be seen in
          churches, city halls, and historic buildings alike. However, it can
          also be found in the humble home. Marble countertops are beloved by
          homeowners for their beauty, and especially by those who love to bake.
          Because the surface always stays cool, it prevents buttery doughs from
          getting too soft and helps temper chocolate to the perfect consistency
          to make truffles, bonbons, and other treats. Although marble
          countertops need frequent sealing and care must be taken to prevent
          staining and acid erosion, the effort is worth it for the suite
          elegance the stone will give your kitchen.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Of course, you can use marble elsewhere in your home. Marble floor
          tiles can look stunning in an entryway, and can also be used to create
          decorative backsplashes in the kitchen or in the bathroom. A marble
          fireplace, whether plain or carved, can also add a little drama and
          elegance to your living room.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          One look at a piece of marble and it’s easy to see why it has been
          beloved for generations. Its smooth, cool surface, elegant veining,
          and unique color palate combine to create something that is
          organically beautiful. Thankfully, this material is no longer just for
          kings. Whether you’d like a small slab in your kitchen to want the
          dramatic look of a carved fireplace, marble is an attainable luxury
          that can be crafted to suit your needs. Looking for a little
          inspiration? Check out our live inventory and begin dreaming about how
          these stones would look in your very own palace.

        <h4>Properties:</h4>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble is formed from limestone by heat and pressure in the earth’s
          crust. These forces cause the limestone to change in texture and
          makeup. This process is called recrystallization. Fossilized materials
          in the limestone, along with its original carbonate minerals,
          recrystallize and form large, coarse grains of calcite. Impurities
          present in the limestone during recrystallization affect the mineral
          composition of the marble that forms. At relatively low temperatures,
          silica impurities in the carbonate minerals form masses of chert or
          crystals of quartz. At higher temperatures, the silica reacts with the
          carbonates to produce diopside and forsterite. At extremely high
          temperatures, rarer calcium minerals, such as larnite, monticellite,
          and rankinite, form in the marble. If water is present, serpentine,
          talc, and certain other hydrous minerals may be produced. The presence
          of iron, alumina, and silica may result in the formation of hematite
          and magnetite.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          The visible crystals in marble give it a characteristic granular
          surface and appearance, but there are other properties used to
          identify the rock.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble is considered to be a strong, hard stone, even though its
          primary mineral, calcite, only has a Mohs hardness of 3. Marble can be
          scratched with a metal blade.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble tends to be light in color. The purest marble is white. Marble
          that contains a lot of bituminous material may be black. Most marble
          is pale gray, pink, brown, green, yellow, or blue.

        <h4>Uses of Marble</h4>
        <br></br>
        <p>
          Marble is a rock widely used in buildings, monuments, and sculptures.
          It consists chiefly of calcite or dolomite, or a combination of these
          carbonate minerals. Most marbles of commercial value was formed in the
          Paleozoic Era or earlier in Precambrian Time. Marble is found in many
          countries, including Belgium, France, Greece, India, Italy, Spain, and
          the United Kingdom. South American nations also have large marble
          deposits. In the United States, Georgia produces the most marble.
          Other chief marble-producing states include Alabama, Colorado,
          Montana, Tennessee, Texas, and Vermont.
