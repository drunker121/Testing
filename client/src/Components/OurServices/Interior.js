        <small>The lower level, comprising the living room, dining room and two bedrooms, is occupied by the parents, while the son resides on the upper floor that has a living room and a bedroom. Spacious decks on both floors ensure the seamless merging of the outdoors with the indoors.</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>The tree of light jali work is an interesting feature separating the puja room and the living room. The vintage-looking cane chairs are customised by Magari, as is the rest of the furniture in the house</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>The upper floor retains the organic theme that permeates the penthouse, this time with a Mark Rothko-inspired aesthetic. The pigmented cement flooring and walls in irregular, painted rectangles are a nod to the American abstract painter’s trademark rectangular colour field paintings.</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>Madan explains, “The roof of the living room is a metal structure that uses a wooden slat false ceiling with a puff panel sheet, creating an immersive
aesthetic view. Adding to this look, we kept the floor slab and roof concrete.”</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>An entire wall in glass, while separating the balcony from the living room, simultaneously allows the seamless flowing together of the indoors and the outdoors.</small><br></br><br></br>
