        <small>Marble was the choice of the royals for its inimitable luxury. This stone comes in numerous colours and vein patterns. Being a natural derivative, each slab is unique, with its own distinct grain. India has rich marble deposits in states like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>One can choose from Makrana, Calacatta, Andhi, Rajnagar, Ambaji, Katni Beige, Udaipur Pink and many other marble stones that are native to the country. You can pick marble slabs local to your area or can get them imported, too.</small><br></br><br></br>

        <small>While choosing your slabs, make sure they are free of cracks and stains. Watch out for manufacturers who supply artificially coloured marble slabs that will start fading soon after installation. Do your market research before you buy. A spot check can be to gently scratch the surface. An artificially coloured stone is generally coated with a sealant to keep the colour intact, and, therefore, does not get scratched easily. A raw, uncoloured (read genuine) stone will show scratches or cuts.</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>Select slabs of the same thickness and dimensions for uniform laying of the floor. Also, buy only good-quality slabs that are verified and have been tested for use. The safest way is to buy from an ISO-certified supplier, as their products are tested and verified. You can try other manufacturers as well, but again, do check up on their client history – if there are many complaints about their products.</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>It is also important that you hire skilled labour for the installation; improper laying of slabs can lead to breakages.</small><br></br><br></br>
        <small>This natural stone can be finished in polished, honed or tumbled textures. Polished marble gives a more posh look – it is well-suited for entryways, living rooms and bedrooms. Quite obviously, the texture chosen will decide if the floor is slippery or not. Honed and tumbled finishes are rougher, suitable to wet areas like bathrooms and balconies.</small><br></br><br></br>

        <small>Marble, being porous in nature, is prone to staining. Food items and cleaning agents containing acids can leave marks on the floor. Hence, polished marble is not recommended for kitchens, dining rooms and bathrooms. A well-sealed, honed marble floor is best for areas that undergo frequent wet cleaning (kitchen, utility rooms and bathrooms). In other spaces, using polished marble or re-polishing can fix minor etches and scratches.</small><br></br><br></br>
